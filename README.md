# Deprecated

The Blazorade MSAL library has been deprecated and this repository has been archived. This is done mainly because of the problems when using Blazorade MSAL in [.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/hybrid/tutorials/maui).

Another Blazorade library will come out that focuses on authentication. This library will support any kind of application on any platform that Blazor is supported on, including .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid applications.

Until then, this repository will be available as an archived, read-only repository. The [Nuget package for Blazorade MSAL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorade.Msal) will also be available, but marked as a legacy package.

# Blazorade MSAL

A Blazor component library that makes it easy to use authentication in your application through MSAL, both in Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly applications.
